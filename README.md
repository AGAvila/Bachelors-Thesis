# Bachelor's Thesis - Wearable System For Biosignal Measurements

In this repository you can find the information of my Bachelor's Thesis. I have developed a wearable and reprogrammable device aimed for use in medical applications. The main objective is to create a device that can be used to measure various parameters and biosignals by reprogramming the software and making minor hardware changes on a core device.

These documents are available in Spanish.

## Project documentation
